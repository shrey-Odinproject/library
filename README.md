Inspired by "michalosman" 's submission the change in read status is now reflected in button
and not in the div which has book info because its easier to change the text in button as it can be
selected and edited directly via click event, for displaying changes to book info's div, will have
to re-render (that's the only way i can think of now) which is a headache to implement rn.
